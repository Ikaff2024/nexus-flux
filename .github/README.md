# Nexus-Flux

Nexus-Flux is an open-core cognitive research framework exploring next-generation
decision systems based on shared-state, convergence-driven architectures.

This repository exposes the **research surface** of the project: architecture,
interfaces, documentation and experimental scaffolding — while intentionally
excluding the proprietary execution core.

---

## Overview

Modern AI systems rely heavily on anthropomorphic agents, prompt chaining and
token-based coordination. These approaches introduce instability, opacity and
poor convergence guarantees in complex decision environments.

Nexus-Flux explores an alternative paradigm:
**cognitive convergence through shared state, vectorial momentum and stabilization
mechanisms**, rather than agent-level dialogue.

---

## Why Nexus-Flux Exists

Nexus-Flux was created to address several structural limitations in current
multi-agent and LLM-driven systems:

- Excessive agent chatter and coordination overhead
- Lack of convergence guarantees
- Poor separation between reasoning, memory and execution
- Limited controllability in high-stakes decision contexts

The project investigates **non-anthropomorphic cognitive architectures**
designed for stability, traceability and long-horizon reasoning.

---

## Architecture (High-Level)

At a high level, Nexus-Flux is organized around:

- A shared cognitive state
- Vector-based signal propagation
- Convergence and stabilization dynamics
- Clear separation between interfaces and execution core

This repository documents the **architecture and contracts**, not the internal
execution engine.

Detailed diagrams and explanations are available in the `/docs` directory.

---

## Open-Core Strategy

Nexus-Flux follows an **open-core research model**:

**Public (this repository):**
- Architecture definitions
- Interfaces and schemas
- Documentation and research notes
- Non-executable scaffolding

**Private / Restricted:**
- Cognitive execution engine
- Convergence and momentum algorithms
- Epistemic core and stabilization logic
- Performance-critical implementations

This separation is intentional and aligned with IP protection and future
licensing strategy.

---

## Repository Scope

This repository is **not intended to be a runnable AI system**.

It is a:
- Research framework
- Architectural reference
- Collaboration and discussion surface

Any apparent absence of full execution logic is **by design**, not an omission.

---

## CI / Tests Status (Important)

Automated CI, linting and test workflows are intentionally disabled or incomplete
during the current research phase.

This repository does not expose the proprietary execution core required for
meaningful runtime tests.

CI failures or disabled workflows should not be interpreted as instability of
the underlying system.

---

## Who Should Use This Repository

This repository is intended for:

- Researchers in AI systems and cognitive architectures
- Engineers exploring alternative multi-agent paradigms
- Institutions evaluating long-term decision frameworks
- Partners interested in licensing or collaboration discussions

It is **not** intended as a plug-and-play SDK.

This repository is provided for research and evaluation purposes only.

All proprietary components, algorithms and execution mechanisms remain the
exclusive property of the project owner and may be subject to patent filings
and licensing terms.

No rights are granted to reproduce, derive or commercialize the proprietary
cognitive core based on this repository alone.
